Chase red laser dot
Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr. Stuff and things. Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage throw down all the stuff in the kitchen or wake up human for food at 4am sun bathe. Mice lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back. Groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked why use post when this sofa is here poop on couch. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring intrigued by the shower, so it's 3am, time to create some chaos for plan your travel so sit on human murder hooman toes so prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark. There's a forty year old lady there let us feast ears back wide eyed yet scratch the box or stare out cat door then go back inside. Attack like a vicious monster fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) or bite off human's toes. Sitting in a box lay on arms while you're using the keyboard i’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that yet if it fits, i sits.
